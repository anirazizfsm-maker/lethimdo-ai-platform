# üéØ ACTION PLAN: FIX NAME SERVERS FOR LETHIMDO.COM

## üö® CURRENT ISSUE
Your domain `lethimdo.com` is currently using parking name servers:
- `ns1.dns-parking.com`
- `ns2.dns-parking.com`

This means DNS changes made in Hostinger won't take effect because your domain is not actually using Hostinger's DNS servers.

You may also be seeing a message in Hostinger saying: **"These nameservers are outdated. Please use Hostinger nameservers option."**

## üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION OVERVIEW
You need to update your domain's name servers to point to Hostinger's DNS servers.

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP ACTION PLAN

### STEP 1: IDENTIFY YOUR DOMAIN REGISTRAR
First, you need to find where your domain `lethimdo.com` is actually registered.

#### How to Find Your Domain Registrar:
1. Check your email for domain purchase receipts
2. Look for emails from domain registrars like:
   - GoDaddy
   - Namecheap
   - Google Domains
   - Name.com
   - Hostinger (if you bought the domain there)

3. Use WHOIS lookup:
   - Go to https://whois.net/lethimdo.com
   - Look for "Registrar" field

### STEP 2: GET HOSTINGER'S NAME SERVERS
1. Login to Hostinger: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Go to "Domains" in the sidebar
3. Find "lethimdo.com" in your domain list
4. Click "Manage" next to it
5. Click "Nameservers" or "DNS / Nameservers"
6. Note the name servers (typically):
   ```
   ns1.hostinger.com
   ns2.hostinger.com
   ns3.hostinger.com
   ns4.hostinger.com
   ```

### STEP 3: UPDATE NAME SERVERS AT YOUR REGISTRAR
Login to your domain registrar and update the name servers:

#### If Registered with GoDaddy:
1. Go to https://dcc.godaddy.com
2. Find "lethimdo.com" in your domain list
3. Click "DNS" or "Manage"
4. Click "Nameservers"
5. Select "Custom"
6. Enter Hostinger's name servers
7. Save

#### If Registered with Namecheap:
1. Go to https://ap.www.namecheap.com
2. Find "lethimdo.com" in your domain list
3. Click "Manage"
4. Go to "Nameservers" tab
5. Select "Custom DNS"
6. Enter Hostinger's name servers
7. Save

#### If Registered with Google Domains:
1. Go to https://domains.google.com
2. Find "lethimdo.com" in your domain list
3. Click on the domain
4. Go to "DNS" section
5. Scroll to "Name servers"
6. Select "Custom name servers"
7. Enter Hostinger's name servers
8. Save

#### If Registered with Name.com:
1. Go to https://www.name.com
2. Login to your account
3. Go to "Domain Names"
4. Click on "lethimdo.com"
5. Click "DNS Management"
6. Select "Custom DNS"
7. Enter Hostinger's name servers
8. Save

#### If Registered with Hostinger (Most Likely):
1. Login to Hostinger: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Go to "Domains" in the sidebar
3. Find "lethimdo.com" in your domain list
4. Click "Manage" next to it
5. Click "Nameservers" or "DNS / Nameservers"
6. Look for an option to use "Hostinger nameservers" (preferred)
7. If not available, select "Custom nameservers"
8. Enter Hostinger's name servers:
   ```
   ns1.hostinger.com
   ns2.hostinger.com
   ns3.hostinger.com
   ns4.hostinger.com
   ```
9. Click "Save"

### STEP 4: WAIT FOR PROPAGATION
- **Time Required**: 24-48 hours
- **Check Progress**: https://dnschecker.org/#NS/lethimdo.com
- **Partial Updates**: May start working in 2-6 hours

### STEP 5: VERIFY NAME SERVER UPDATE
Run our verification script:
```
.\check-name-servers.bat
```

You should now see Hostinger's name servers instead of parking servers, and the "outdated nameservers" message should disappear.

### STEP 6: RECONFIGURE DNS IN HOSTINGER
After name server propagation:

1. Login to Hostinger: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Go to "Domains" ‚Üí "lethimdo.com" ‚Üí "Manage" ‚Üí "DNS Zone"
3. Add these records:

**A Record for root domain:**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or blank)
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600
```

**CNAME Record for www:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: lethimdoai.netlify.app
TTL: 3600
```

### STEP 7: RE-ADD CUSTOM DOMAIN IN RENDER.COM
1. Go to Render.com dashboard
2. Remove `api.lethimdo.com` custom domain if it exists
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Re-add `api.lethimdo.com` as custom domain
5. The TXT verification record should now appear
