# üö® TROUBLESHOOTING: MISSING TXT VERIFICATION RECORD

## üéØ ISSUE DESCRIPTION
After adding the custom domain `api.lethimdo.com` in Render.com, you're not seeing the required TXT verification record in your DNS zone. This is preventing the domain verification process from completing.

## üîç POSSIBLE CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS

### 1. **Refresh and Wait Issue**
Sometimes Render.com takes a few moments to generate the verification details.

#### Solution:
1. Refresh the Render.com dashboard page
2. Navigate to your service ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Custom Domains
3. Click on the `api.lethimdo.com` domain entry
4. Look for a "Verify" or "Details" button
5. The TXT verification record should appear after clicking this

### 2. **Domain Already Added with Different Verification**
The domain might have been added previously with a different verification method.

#### Solution:
1. Remove the custom domain from Render.com:
   - In Custom Domains section, find `api.lethimdo.com`
   - Click the trash/delete icon
   - Confirm deletion
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for cleanup
3. Re-add the custom domain:
   - Click "Add Custom Domain"
   - Enter `api.lethimdo.com`
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - The TXT record should now appear

### 3. **UI Display Issue in Render.com**
Sometimes the verification details are hidden or not immediately visible.

#### Solution:
1. Look for expandable sections or "Show Details" buttons
2. Check if there's a separate "Verification" tab
3. Try using a different browser or incognito mode
4. Clear browser cache and cookies for render.com

### 4. **Domain Ownership Verification Required**
Render.com might need to verify you own the domain before showing verification details.

#### Solution:
1. Check your email for verification messages from Render.com
2. Look for domain ownership verification steps in Render.com dashboard
3. You might need to add a temporary TXT record to prove domain ownership first

## üõ†Ô∏è ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

### Option 1: Manual TXT Record Creation
If Render.com doesn't show the verification record, you can try creating one manually:

1. In Render.com, note the service ID (part of your service URL like `lethimdo-backend-abcd1234`)
2. Create a TXT record in Hostinger with:
   ```
   Name: _render-api.lethimdo.com
   Value: render-site-id=lethimdo-backend-abcd1234
   TTL: 3600
   ```
3. Wait 10-15 minutes for DNS propagation
4. Check back in Render.com to see if verification succeeds

### Option 2: Contact Render.com Support
If none of the above works:

1. Go to https://render.com/contact
2. Explain the issue:
   - You've added `api.lethimdo.com` as a custom domain
   - No TXT verification record is showing in the UI
   - You need the verification details to configure DNS
3. Include screenshots if possible

## üß™ VERIFICATION STEPS

### Check Current DNS Records
Run this command to see what DNS records currently exist:
```
nslookup -type=TXT lethimdo.com
nslookup -type=TXT api.lethimdo.com
```

### Check Domain Registration
Verify you're making changes to the correct domain:
1. Go to https://whois.net/lethimdo.com
2. Confirm the domain is registered with Hostinger
3. Ensure you're logged into the correct Hostinger account

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:
1. Try refreshing the Render.com dashboard
2. Remove and re-add the custom domain
3. Check for hidden verification details
4. Look for emails from Render.com about domain verification

### If Still Not Working:
1. Try the manual TXT record approach
2. Contact Render.com support
3. Document all steps taken for support ticket
