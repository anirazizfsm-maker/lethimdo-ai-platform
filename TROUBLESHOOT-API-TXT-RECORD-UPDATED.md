# üö® TROUBLESHOOTING: MISSING TXT VERIFICATION RECORD (UPDATED)

## üéØ ISSUE DESCRIPTION
After adding the custom domain `api.lethimdo.com` in Render.com, you're not seeing the required TXT verification record in your DNS zone. Based on our DNS check, we can see that your domain is currently using parking name servers rather than Hostinger's name servers.

You may also be seeing a message in Hostinger saying: **"These nameservers are outdated. Please use Hostinger nameservers option."**

## üîç KEY FINDINGS FROM DNS CHECK

### Current DNS Configuration:
- **Name Servers**: `ns1.dns-parking.com` and `ns2.dns-parking.com` (NOT Hostinger's)
- **Frontend Domain**: `lethimdo.com` correctly points to Netlify (75.2.60.5)
- **WWW Subdomain**: Unknown status
- **API Subdomain**: `api.lethimdo.com` does not exist yet (expected)

## üö® IMPORTANT DISCOVERY

Your domain is currently using parking name servers (`dns-parking.com`) rather than Hostinger's name servers. This means:

1. **DNS changes made in Hostinger won't take effect** because the domain is not actually using Hostinger's DNS servers
2. **You need to update your name servers** to point to Hostinger's DNS servers
3. **Hostinger correctly detects this issue** and shows a warning message

However, your frontend domain is working because someone likely configured an A record at the registrar level (not in Hostinger).

## üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION: UPDATE NAME SERVERS

### Step 1: Get Hostinger's Name Servers
1. Login to Hostinger: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Go to "Domains" ‚Üí "lethimdo.com" ‚Üí "Manage"
3. Look for "Nameservers" or "DNS / Nameservers" section
4. Note the name servers (typically something like):
   ```
   ns1.hostinger.com
   ns2.hostinger.com
   ns3.hostinger.com
   ns4.hostinger.com
   ```

For detailed navigation instructions, see: [HOSTINGER-SPECIFIC-NAVIGATION-GUIDE.md](HOSTINGER-SPECIFIC-NAVIGATION-GUIDE.md)

### Step 2: Update Name Servers at Domain Registrar
You need to find where your domain is actually registered. Since you're seeing parking name servers, it's likely registered with a different provider.

1. Check your email for domain purchase receipt to identify registrar
2. Common registrars:
   - GoDaddy: domains.godaddy.com
   - Namecheap: namecheap.com
   - Google Domains: domains.google.com
   - Name.com: name.com

3. Login to your domain registrar
4. Find "Nameservers" or "DNS Management" section
5. Replace the current parking name servers with Hostinger's name servers:
   ```
   ns1.hostinger.com
   ns2.hostinger.com
   ns3.hostinger.com
   ns4.hostinger.com
   ```

### Step 3: Wait for Name Server Propagation
- **Time Required**: 24-48 hours (can be faster, but up to 48 hours)
- **Check Progress**: https://dnschecker.org/#NS/lethimdo.com

## üîÑ AFTER NAME SERVER UPDATE

### Step 1: Verify Name Servers
Run our DNS check script:
```
.\check-current-dns.bat
```

You should now see Hostinger's name servers instead of parking servers, and the "outdated nameservers" message should disappear.

### Step 2: Add DNS Records in Hostinger
1. Login to Hostinger: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Go to "Domains" ‚Üí "lethimdo.com" ‚Üí "Manage" ‚Üí "DNS Zone"
3. Add these records:

**A Record for root domain:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600
```

**CNAME Record for www:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: lethimdoai.netlify.app
TTL: 3600
```

**CNAME Record for API (when ready):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: api
Value: lethimdo-backend-xxxx.onrender.com
TTL: 3600
```

### Step 3: Re-add Custom Domain in Render.com
1. Go to Render.com dashboard
2. Remove `api.lethimdo.com` custom domain if it exists
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Re-add `api.lethimdo.com` as custom domain
5. The TXT verification record should now appear

## üß™ VERIFICATION AFTER NAME SERVER UPDATE

### Check Name Servers:
```
nslookup -type=NS lethimdo.com
```

Should show Hostinger's name servers instead of parking servers.

### Check TXT Records:
```
nslookup -type=TXT lethimdo.com
```

Should show any TXT records you've added.

## üéØ ALTERNATIVE QUICK SOLUTION

If you can't update name servers right now, you can try this alternative:

### Use Render.com's Automatic SSL with Netlify DNS
1. Keep your domain with the current registrar
2. Add these records to your current DNS provider:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: api
   Value: 75.2.60.5
   TTL: 3600
   
   Type: CNAME
   Name: _render-api.lethimdo.com
   Value: lethimdo-backend-xxxx.onrender.com
   TTL: 3600
   ```

3. In Render.com, add the custom domain and wait for verification

  Subject: Missing TXT Verification Record for Custom Domain api.lethimdo.com
  
  Hello Render.com Support,
  
  I'm trying to configure a custom domain (api.lethimdo.com) for my service (lethimdo-backend), but I'm not seeing the required TXT verification record in the dashboard. My domain appears to be using parking name servers instead of my DNS provider's servers, which might be causing this issue.
  
  Can you please help me obtain the TXT verification record needed to verify ownership of api.lethimdo.com?
  
  Thank you,
  [Your Name]
  ```

### Cost Impact:
- No additional costs for name server changes
- This is a one-time configuration that will benefit all future DNS management
- Maintains your cost-effective hosting setup

### Time Considerations:
- Name server propagation: 24-48 hours
- After propagation, DNS changes are immediate
- Plan this change when you can wait for propagation

### Client Impact:
- Frontend (lethimdo.com) will continue working during name server propagation
- API subdomain setup will be possible after propagation
- No impact on existing deployed services
