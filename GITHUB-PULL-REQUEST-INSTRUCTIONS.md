# How to Create a Pull Request on GitHub

Now that you've pushed your changes to GitHub, here's how to create a pull request:

## Step 1: Visit the Pull Request Creation URL

GitHub has automatically provided you with a direct link to create a pull request:
https://github.com/anirazizfsm-maker/lethimdo-ai-platform/pull/new/feature/pr-example

You can also navigate to this manually:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/anirazizfsm-maker/lethimdo-ai-platform
2. Click on the "Pull requests" tab
3. Click the "New pull request" button
4. Select your branch (`feature/pr-example`) as the "compare" branch

## Step 2: Fill in the Pull Request Details

### Title
Enter a descriptive title for your pull request:
```
Add PR example files for demonstration
```

### Description
Use the example we created earlier. Copy and paste this into the description field:

```

## Using the GitHub Web Interface
