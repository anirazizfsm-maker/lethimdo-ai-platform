# üö® IMMEDIATE DNS FIX GUIDE FOR LETHIMDO.COM

## üéØ **CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS**

Based on our DNS checks, here's what we know:

‚úÖ **Frontend Domain Working**: `lethimdo.com` correctly points to Netlify IP (75.2.60.5)
‚ùå **Name Servers Still Parking**: Using `ns1.dns-parking.com` and `ns2.dns-parking.com`
‚ùå **API Subdomain Not Working**: `api.lethimdo.com` doesn't exist yet
‚ùå **TXT Record Missing**: No TXT verification record for Render.com

## üîç **WHY THIS IS HAPPENING**

Even though your frontend domain is working, it's likely because:
1. Someone manually configured an A record at the registrar level (not in Hostinger)
2. But the name servers are still pointing to parking servers
3. This means DNS changes in Hostinger won't take effect
4. Render.com can't verify the domain because the TXT record can't be added

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Fix Name Servers in Hostinger (Recommended)**

#### Step 1: Login to Hostinger
1. Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Login with your credentials

#### Step 2: Update Name Servers
1. Go to **"Domains"** ‚Üí **"lethimdo.com"** ‚Üí **"Manage"**
2. Click **"Nameservers"** or **"DNS / Nameservers"**
3. Look for the message: **"These nameservers are outdated. Please use Hostinger nameservers option."**
4. Select **"Use Hostinger nameservers"** or **"Use custom nameservers"**
5. If using custom nameservers, enter:
   ```
   ns1.hostinger.com
   ns2.hostinger.com
   ns3.hostinger.com
   ns4.hostinger.com
   ```
6. Click **"Save"**

#### Step 3: Wait for Propagation (24-48 hours)
During this time, your frontend will continue working.

**For detailed Hostinger navigation instructions, see: [HOSTINGER-SPECIFIC-NAVIGATION-GUIDE.md](HOSTINGER-SPECIFIC-NAVIGATION-GUIDE.md)**

### **Option 2: Add DNS Records at Current Registrar (Quick Fix)**

If you can't access the name server settings or need a quicker solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Your Current Registrar
Check your email for domain purchase receipts to identify where `lethimdo.com` is registered.
See: [IDENTIFY-DOMAIN-REGISTRAR-GUIDE.md](IDENTIFY-DOMAIN-REGISTRAR-GUIDE.md) - Complete guide to identify your registrar

#### Step 2: Login to Current Registrar
Login to wherever you originally purchased the domain (might not be Hostinger).

#### Step 3: Add These DNS Records
Add these records at your current registrar's DNS management:

**For API Subdomain Verification:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: _render-api.lethimdo.com
Value: [RENDER_PROVIDED_TXT_VALUE]
TTL: 3600
```

**For API Subdomain:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: api.lethimdo.com
Value: lethimdo-backend-xxxx.onrender.com
TTL: 3600
```

*Note: You'll get the exact TXT value from Render.com dashboard*

## üîÑ **AFTER IMPLEMENTING SOLUTION**

### If You Chose Option 1 (Name Server Fix):
1. After 24-48 hours, log back into Hostinger
2. Go to **"DNS Zone"** for lethimdo.com
3. Add the API subdomain records:
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: _render-api.lethimdo.com
   Value: [RENDER_PROVIDED_TXT_VALUE]
   TTL: 3600
   
   Type: CNAME
   Name: api
   Value: lethimdo-backend-xxxx.onrender.com
   TTL: 3600
   ```
4. In Render.com, remove and re-add `api.lethimdo.com` as custom domain
5. The TXT verification record should now appear

### If You Chose Option 2 (Registrar DNS Records):
1. In Render.com, remove and re-add `api.lethimdo.com` as custom domain
2. The TXT verification record should now appear (since you already added it)
3. Complete the verification process

## üß™ **VERIFICATION STEPS**

### Check Name Servers:
```cmd
nslookup -type=NS lethimdo.com
```
Should show Hostinger's name servers after Option 1 propagation.

### Check TXT Records:
```cmd
nslookup -type=TXT _render-api.lethimdo.com
```
Should show the Render verification record.

### Check API Subdomain:
```cmd
nslookup api.lethimdo.com
```
Should show the Render.com backend address.

## üö® **EMERGENCY FALLBACK**

If you need to get your API working immediately:

### Use Render.com's Direct URL:
Instead of `api.lethimdo.com`, use the direct Render.com URL:
```
https://lethimdo-backend.onrender.com
```

Update your frontend environment variables:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://lethimdo-backend.onrender.com
```

This will work immediately without any DNS changes.

Subject: "Urgent: Custom Domain Verification Failed for api.lethimdo.com"
Message:
```
Hello Render.com Support,

I'm trying to configure a custom domain (api.lethimdo.com) for my service (lethimdo-backend), but I'm having issues with the TXT verification record.

Current DNS configuration shows:
- Name servers: ns1.dns-parking.com, ns2.dns-parking.com
- Frontend domain (lethimdo.com): Working correctly (points to 75.2.60.5)
- API subdomain: Not working
- TXT verification record: Missing

I've tried [describe what you've tried] but still can't get the verification to work.

Can you please help me resolve this issue?

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

## ‚è∞ **EXPECTED TIMELINE**

### If Using Option 1 (Name Server Fix):
- **Day 1**: Update name servers, wait for propagation
- **Day 2-3**: Add DNS records in Hostinger, configure Render.com
- **Day 3**: Test and verify

### If Using Option 2 (Registrar DNS):
- **Today**: Add DNS records at registrar
- **Within 1 hour**: Configure Render.com
- **Today**: Test and verify

## üáßüá© **BANGLADESH FREELANCE AGENCY NOTES**

### Cost Impact:
- Both options are FREE
- No additional costs for either solution
- Maintains your cost-effective hosting setup

### Client Impact:
- Frontend (lethimdo.com) continues working in both options
- API subdomain will work after implementation
- No impact on existing deployed services

### Recommendation:
- **Option 1** is better for long-term management
- **Option 2** is better for immediate needs
- You can implement Option 2 now and Option 1 later for better DNS management
