# GitHub Actions Guide for Lethimdo

This guide explains how to set up and use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment of the Lethimdo platform, specifically tailored for Bangladesh freelance agencies.

## üéØ GitHub Actions Overview

### Why Use GitHub Actions?
1. **Automated Testing** - Run tests automatically on every push or pull request
2. **Continuous Integration** - Ensure code quality and prevent breaking changes
3. **Continuous Deployment** - Automatically deploy to hosting platforms
4. **Cost-Effective** - Free tier available for open source projects
5. **Bangladesh Agency Friendly** - No billing address restrictions

## üöÄ Setting Up GitHub Actions

### Prerequisites
1. GitHub repository (already set up)
2. Netlify account for frontend deployment
3. Render.com account for backend deployment

### Workflow Files
We've created three workflow files in `.github/workflows/`:
1. `frontend-test.yml` - Tests the frontend on push/PR
2. `frontend-deploy.yml` - Deploys frontend to Netlify on push to main
3. `backend-test.yml` - Tests the backend on push/PR

## üß™ Frontend Testing Workflow

### What It Does
- Runs on every push to main branch and every pull request
- Tests against multiple Node.js versions (18.x and 20.x)
- Installs dependencies and runs test suite

### Configuration
```yaml
name: Frontend Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
        cache-dependency-path: frontend/package-lock.json
    
    - name: Install frontend dependencies
      run: |
        cd frontend
        npm ci
    
    - name: Run frontend tests
      run: |
        cd frontend
        npm run test
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Frontend Deployment Workflow

### What It Does
- Runs only on push to main branch
- Builds the frontend application
- Deploys to Netlify automatically

### Configuration
```yaml
name: Frontend Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '20'
        cache: 'npm'
        cache-dependency-path: frontend/package-lock.json
    
    - name: Install frontend dependencies
      run: |
        cd frontend
        npm ci
    
    - name: Build frontend
      run: |
        cd frontend
        npm run build
    
    - name: Deploy to Netlify
      uses: netlify/actions/cli@master
      env:
        NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
        NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
      with:
        args: deploy --dir=frontend/dist --prod
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

## üß™ Backend Testing Workflow

### What It Does
- Runs on every push to main branch and every pull request
- Tests against multiple Node.js versions (18.x and 20.x)
- Installs dependencies and runs test suite

### Configuration
```yaml
name: Backend Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
        cache-dependency-path: backend/package-lock.json
    
    - name: Install backend dependencies
      run: |
        cd backend
        npm ci
    
    - name: Run backend tests
      run: |
        cd backend
        npm run test
```

## üîê Setting Up Secrets
