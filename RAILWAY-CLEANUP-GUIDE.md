# Railway Cleanup Guide - Lethimdo Project

## Why Delete Railway Project?

Since Railway has restricted free accounts to database-only deployments, keeping the project serves no purpose for your backend deployment needs. Clean deletion helps:

- ✅ **Avoid confusion** with multiple deployment attempts
- ✅ **Prevent accidental charges** if you accidentally upgrade
- ✅ **Keep your account organized** for future use
- ✅ **Focus on Render.com** as your primary backend hosting solution

## Step-by-Step Railway Cleanup

### 1. Access Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to your project dashboard

### 2. Locate Your Lethimdo Project
- Look for your backend project (likely named "lethimdo-backend" or similar)
- Click on the project to open it

### 3. Delete the Project
1. **Project Settings**: Click on the project name → "Settings"
2. **Danger Zone**: Scroll down to find the "Danger Zone" section
3. **Delete Project**: Click "Delete Project"
4. **Confirmation**: Type the project name to confirm deletion
5. **Final Delete**: Click the final delete button

### 4. Clean Up Any Connected Services
- **GitHub Integration**: The connection will be automatically removed
- **Environment Variables**: Will be deleted with the project
- **Custom Domains**: Remove any custom domain configurations if you had any

### 5. Verify Deletion
- Check your Railway dashboard to ensure the project is gone
- Verify no active services are running

## Alternative: Keep for Future Database Use

If you plan to use Railway for database hosting in the future (which is still available on free tier), you could:

1. **Rename the project** to "lethimdo-database-only"
2. **Remove all web service configurations**
3. **Keep only database configurations** for future use

## Focus on Render.com

With Railway cleaned up, you can now focus entirely on:
- ✅ **Render.com backend deployment** (currently in progress)
- ✅ **Netlify frontend hosting** (already deployed)
- ✅ **Hostinger DNS configuration** (already configured)

## Cost Savings for Bangladesh Agency

Cleaning up unused services aligns with your cost-effective approach:
- **$0/month Railway**: No unused services
- **$0/month Render.com**: Free tier for backend
- **$0/month Netlify**: Free tier for frontend
- **~$10-15/year Hostinger**: Domain management only

## Next Steps After Cleanup

1. ✅ **Complete Render.com deployment** (current priority)
2. ✅ **Test deployed backend API**
3. ✅ **Update frontend configuration**
4. ✅ **Configure OpenAI API integration**
5. ✅ **Launch your international freelance agency platform**
