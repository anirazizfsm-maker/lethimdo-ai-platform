1. Go to your repository's Issues tab: https://github.com/anirazizfsm-maker/lethimdo-ai-platform/issues
2. Click "New issue"
3. Add a title: "Improve Dashboard UI with Enhanced Animations"
4. Add a description:
   ```
   The current DashboardCard component could benefit from enhanced hover animations to provide a more engaging user experience.
   
   ## Requirements
   - Add subtle scaling effect on hover
   - Include smooth transition animations
   - Ensure animations are performant
   - Maintain accessibility standards

```

## üíª Step 3: Make Code Changes

Edit the DashboardCard component to add enhanced animations:

   // Add group-hover:scale-110 to the icon container
   // Add transition-transform to smooth animations
   ```

## üíæ Step 4: Commit and Push Changes

Using our workflow script:
```
.\github-workflow.bat
```
Select option 2: "Commit changes"
Enter commit message: "Improve DashboardCard hover effects with animations"

Then select option 3: "Push current branch to GitHub"

Or using Git directly:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Improve DashboardCard hover effects with animations"
git push -u origin feature/improve-dashboard-ui
```

## üîÑ Step 5: Create a Pull Request
