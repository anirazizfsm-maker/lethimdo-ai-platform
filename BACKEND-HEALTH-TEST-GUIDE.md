## 🌐 **Step 1: Get Your Backend URL**

### **From Render Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your `lethimdo-backend` service
3. At the top, you'll see your URL like:
   ```
   https://lethimdo-backend-xxxx.onrender.com
   ```
4. **Copy this URL** - this is your professional backend API!

## 🧪 **Step 2: Test Health Endpoint**

### **Method 1: Browser Test (Recommended)**
1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Paste your backend URL**
3. **Add `/health` to the end**
4. **Example**: `https://lethimdo-backend-abc123.onrender.com/health`
5. **Press Enter**

### **Method 2: PowerShell Test**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/health"

```
