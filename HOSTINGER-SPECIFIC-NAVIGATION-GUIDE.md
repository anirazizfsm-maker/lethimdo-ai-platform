# üéØ HOSTINGER SPECIFIC NAVIGATION GUIDE FOR DNS FIX

## üéØ **UNDERSTANDING THE "NAMESERVERS ARE OUTDATED" MESSAGE**

This message appears because your domain is registered with Hostinger but is using parking name servers instead of Hostinger's DNS servers. You need to update this in the Hostinger control panel.

   ns2.hostinger.com
   ns3.hostinger.com
   ns4.hostinger.com
   ```

3. Click **"Save"**, **"Update"**, or **"Apply Changes"**

Can you please guide me to the exact location where I can make this change?
