## 🔧 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: Build Fails**
**Symptoms**: Build stops with errors
**Solutions**:
- Verify `backend` folder exists in your repository
- Check if `package.json` is in the backend directory
- Ensure all dependencies are listed correctly

### **Issue 2: Service Won't Start**
**Symptoms**: Build succeeds but service fails to start
**Solutions**:
- Verify start command is `npm start`
- Check if `simple-server.js` exists in backend folder
- Ensure PORT environment variable is set to 10000

## 🌐 **Finding Your Backend URL:**

### **Method 1: Render Dashboard**
1. Go to your service in Render dashboard
2. Look for the URL at the top (usually looks like)

   https://lethimdo-backend-xxxx.onrender.com
   ```
3. The `xxxx` part is auto-generated by Render

### **Method 2: Settings Tab**
1. Click on your service
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Find "Domains" section for your URL

## 🧪 **Testing Your Deployment:**

### **Health Check Test**
Once you have your URL, test these endpoints:

1. **Basic Health Check**:
   ```
   https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","uptime":...}`

2. **Basic API Test**:
   ```
   https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/
   ```
   Should return: `{"message":"Lethimdo API","version":"1.0.0"}`

### **Expected Response Format**:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## 🚨 **If Deployment Completely Fails:**

### **Alternative 1: Manual Deploy**
1. In Render dashboard, click "Manual Deploy"

Verify your GitHub repository has:
- `backend/package.json` ✅
- `backend/simple-server.js` ✅
- `backend/src/` directory ✅
- Latest commits pushed ✅

### **Alternative 3: Contact Support**
If technical issues persist:
1. Check Render status page: https://status.render.com
2. Review Render documentation: https://render.com/docs
3. Consider alternative deployment (DigitalOcean, Heroku)
